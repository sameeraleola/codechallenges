Imagine a school that children attend for years. In each year, there are a certain number of groups started, marked with the letters. So if years = 7 and groups = 4For the first year, the groups are 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and for the last year, the groups are 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d.

Write a function that returns the groups in the school by year (as a string), separated with a comma and space in the form of "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b (....) 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d".

Examples:

csSchoolYearsAndGroups(years = 7, groups = 4) âžž "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d"
Notes:

1 <= years <= 10
1 <= groups <=26
[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] integer years

[input] integer groups

[output] string

----------------------------------------------------------------

SOLUTION
Just use a double for loop to generate all years and groups. Join them with a
comma and space in the end.

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

def csSchoolYearsAndGroups(years, groups):
    res = []
    for year in range(years):
        for group in range(groups):
            res.append(f"{str(year + 1)}{str(letters[group])}")
    return ', '.join(res)
